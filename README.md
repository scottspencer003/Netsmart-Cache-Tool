# Netsmart-Cache-Tool
Windows form application in C# that resets the cache folder of the health record application at the company I work for. The folder is renamed with the date so that data is not lost if we need to revert the change. It also closes the app so that the directory can be worked on and cleans up any existing backups that exist past a certain date
I built this app to assist our clinical staff with common issues in our patient record application that can occur from a corrupted cache folder.
This was a first attempt at a winform application so some tweaks for best practices are in the works. I also plan to add further functionality.
